## Composition 10.30 AM

chain in lodash, limitation : not extendable

pipe versus chaining
- easier syntaxe

pipe
- function composition

```js
pipe(a, b, c, d)
```

order from d to a and share result between each function until final result

### In React ?

Enhance components with functions

```js
import { compose }Â from 'ramda';
```

declarative composition for preventing function nesting

>**Polished** : css in js tool with composition

Compose styles to components

**Example**
```js
const tmpColor = lighten(0.3, '#F50');
```

Lighten can be composed with any color modification function

Requirements:
- input/output css values in functions
- every function return a function with color as an argument

**currying** notion : transform each arguments to a function

Native support in some languages
- ReasonML
- ELM

>lodash map : Revert arguments for composition
```js
map((name => name), names)
```

**Loading indicator example**

### Automatically condition Component with a loading state from props

```js
const withLoading = Component => ({ loading }) => (
  loading ? <div>loading</div> : <Component />
);
```

### With text

```js
const withLoading = text => Component => ({ loading }) => (
  loading ? <div>{text}</div> : <Component />
);

withLoading('Loading')(<section />);
```

**Animation example**

In this example 3D rendering is used and the animation of the y axis is extracted in a HOC

Benefits :
- testability
- isolation
- reusability

## The making of Twitter Lite 11:00 AM

Issue : slow internet dominates
- 47% 2G connection
- 21% 4G
- other 3G

The need of a very performant PWA

**Performance optimization**

Painting cycle :
- Splashscreen
- Header
- Content (First meaningful Paint)
- Interactive

### Working ideas

- Involving designers with shared language for better interface communication
- Full flexbox layout
